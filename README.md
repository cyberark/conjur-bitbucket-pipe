# Conjur Bitbucket Pipe

This Pipe allows you to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets from
Conjur variables, and make them available as environment variables in your
Bitbucket pipelines.

This repo is a **Certified** level project. It's been reviewed by CyberArk to
verify that it will securely work with CyberArk Enterprise as documented. In
addition, CyberArk offers Enterprise-level support for these features. For more
detailed information on our certification levels, see
[our community guidelines](https://github.com/cyberark/community/blob/main/Conjur/conventions/certification-levels.md#certified).

## Requirements

- A Bitbucket Cloud repository with a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file
- Conjur Open Source, Enterprise, or Cloud

## Authenticator setup

Example policy for the Bitbucket authenticator:

```yaml

- !policy
  id: conjur/authn-jwt/bitbucket
  body:
    - !webservice
    
    - !variable provider-uri
    - !variable token-app-property
    - !variable identity-path
    
    - !group authenticatable
    - !permit
      role: !group authenticatable
      privilege: [ read, authenticate ]
      resource: !webservice

# Create a policy to contain any Bitbucket pipelines
- !policy
  id: bitbucket-pipelines
  body:
    - !group

    - &hosts
      - !host
        id: "{<bitbucket-repository-uuid>}" # Replace this with your repositoryUuid
      # Add more hosts here for other Bitbucket repositories if needed
    
    - !grant
      role: !group
      members: *hosts

    # Create some secrets for the pipelines to use
    - &variables
      - !variable secret1
      - !variable secret2
    
    # Allow the pipelines to read the variables
    - !permit
      role: !group
      privilege: [ read, execute ]
      resource: *variables

  # If using multiple Bitbucket repositories, allow each repository to read
  # only the variables it needs, to avoid exposing secrets to other repositories

# Add the pipelines to the group that can authenticate using authn-jwt/bitbucket
- !grant
  role: !group authn-jwt/bitbucket/ci/authenticatable
  members: !group bitbucket-pipelines
```

After loading this policy into Conjur, add values for the authenticator variables:

```bash
# Replace `<workspace-name>` with your Bitbucket workspace name
conjur variable set -i conjur/authn-jwt/bitbucket/provider-uri -v "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/<workspace-name>/pipelines-config/identity/oidc"

conjur variable set -i conjur/authn-jwt/bitbucket/token-app-property -v "repositoryUuid"

# This is the path in the Conjur policy where the Bitbucket pipeline hosts are defined
conjur variable set -i conjur/authn-jwt/bitbucket/identity-path -v "bitbucket-pipelines"
```

## YAML Definition

To use this Pipe in your Bitbucket pipeline, add the following to the
`bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml

- step:
  name: 'Retrieve secrets from Conjur'
  oidc: true # This instructs Bitbucket to use provide OIDC credentials to the Pipe
  script:
    - pipe: docker://cyberark/conjur-bitbucket-pipe:edge # TODO: This will change when the Pipe is published
      variables:
        CONJUR_URL: 'https://<your-conjur-url>'
        CONJUR_ACCOUNT: '<your-conjur-account>' # Defaults to 'conjur'
        CONJUR_SERVICE_ID: 'bitbucket' # Service ID of the JWT Authenticator in Conjur. Defaults to 'bitbucket'
        SECRETS: 'bitbucket-pipelines/secret1,bitbucket-pipelines/secret2' # Comma-separated list of Conjur variable IDs
    - . ./.secrets/load_secrets.sh
    # Now you can access the secrets as environment variables
    # For example,
    - echo "Secret 1: $secret1"
```

When the Pipe is run, it will authenticate with Conjur using the OIDC
credentials provided by Bitbucket, and retrieve the secrets specified in the
`SECRETS` variable. The secrets will be written to a `.secrets` folder under the
current working directory, and can be accessed within the same step of the
pipeline. After running the generated script, `.secrets/load_secrets.sh`, the
secrets will be available as environment variables. For example, if you have a
secret with the ID `name/of/secret1`, you can access it in your pipeline as the
environment variable `secret1`.

## Advanced Usage

When the Pipe runs, it creates two files in a new directory named `.secrets`:
`load_secrets.sh` and `secrets.env`. The `secrets.env` file contains
the secrets as key-value pairs, and can be used directly by scripts and
applications that make use of the .env ("dotenv") file format. The
`load_secrets.sh` script is provided as a convenience to load the secrets from
the `secrets.env` file into the shell environment. It also deletes the
`secrets.env` file after loading the secrets, to prevent it from being read
again by subsequent processes in the pipeline.

You can customize the behavior of the Pipe by loading the `secrets.env` file
directly in your scripts or applications, instead of using the `load_secrets.sh`
script. If you choose to do this, be sure to delete the `secrets.env` file after
loading the secrets, to prevent it from being read again by subsequent
processes in the pipeline.

## Limitations

- The Pipe only supports OIDC authentication with Conjur. API key authentication
  is not supported.
- Secrets are written to a subdirectory of the current working directory, which is
  accessible to all processes within the pipeline step. Be careful not to expose
  secrets to unauthorized processes.
- Conjur variable names will be converted to environment variable names by
  removing any paths and using only the last component of the variable name. For
  example, a variable with the ID `name/of/secret1` will be available as the
  environment variable `secret1`. If multiple variables have the same last
  component, an error will occur.
- Due to the use of the `.env` file format, secrets with special characters
  other than `_` are not supported and will produce an error, and variable
  names cannot start with a number.
